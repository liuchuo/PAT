1108. Finding Average (20)
The basic task is simple: given N real numbers, you are supposed to calculate their average. But what makes it complicated is that some of the input numbers might not be legal. A "legal" input is a real number in [-1000, 1000] and is accurate up to no more than 2 decimal places. When you calculate the average, those illegal numbers must not be counted in.
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=100). Then N numbers are given in the next line, separated by one space.
Output Specification:
For each illegal input number, print in a line "ERROR: X is not a legal number" where X is the input. Then finally print in a line the result: "The average of K numbers is Y" where K is the number of legal inputs and Y is their average, accurate to 2 decimal places. In case the average cannot be calculated, output "Undefined" instead of Y. In case K is only 1, output "The average of 1 number is Y" instead.
Sample Input 1:
7
5 -3.2 aaa 9999 2.3.4 7.123 2.35
Sample Output 1:
ERROR: aaa is not a legal number
ERROR: 9999 is not a legal number
ERROR: 2.3.4 is not a legal number
ERROR: 7.123 is not a legal number
The average of 3 numbers is 1.38
Sample Input 2:
2
aaa -9999
Sample Output 2:
ERROR: aaa is not a legal number
ERROR: -9999 is not a legal number
The average of 0 numbers is Undefined

sscanf() - 从一个字符串中读进与指定格式相符的数据
sprintf() - 字符串格式化命令，主要功能是把格式化的数据写入某个字符串中。

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <string.h>
