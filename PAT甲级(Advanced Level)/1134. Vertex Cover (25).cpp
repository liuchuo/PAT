1134. Vertex Cover (25)
A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. Now given a graph with several vertex sets, you are supposed to tell if each of them is a vertex cover or not.
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers N and M (both no more than 104), being the total numbers of vertices and the edges, respectively. Then M lines follow, each describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to N-1) of the two ends of the edge.
After the graph, a positive integer K (<= 100) is given, which is the number of queries. Then K lines of queries follow, each in the format:
Nv v[1] v[2] ... v[Nv]
where Nv is the number of vertices in the set, and v[i]’s are the indices of the vertices.
Output Specification:
For each query, print in a line "Yes" if the set is a vertex cover, or "No" if not.
